Filler analyzer: Takes a TimeSeries object and returns two Floats.


These metrics are described and used in:

Hellyer et al. The Control of Global Brain Dynamics: Opposing Actions
of Frontoparietal Control and Default Mode Networks on Attention. 
The Journal of Neuroscience, January 8, 2014,  34(2):451â€“ 461

Proxy metastability: the variability in spatial coherence of the signal
globally or locally (within a network) over time.
